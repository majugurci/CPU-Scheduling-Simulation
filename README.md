Practical wrok for bachelor thesis

This application was developed for the purpose of bachelor thesis. Application is simplified and only four simple algorithms were implemented. Those are FIFO, SJN, RR and byPriority. Most of the code was written in JavaScript with a little help of PHP. Only thing that is not my work is design of pages which I downloaded from free templates (it is credited in footer of page).
Since this application was mix of JS and PHP there is a lot of JSON use. Application doesn't use database, instead for data storage were used cookies and web storage. Animations were created with Green Sock Animation Platform (GSAP) JS library.
