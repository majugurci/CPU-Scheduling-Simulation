Practical wrok for bachelor thesis

The application was developed for the purpose of bachelor thesis. Application is simplified and only four simple algorithms were implemented. Those are FIFO, SJN, RR and byPriority. Most of the code was written in JavaScript with a little help of PHP. The only thing that is not my work is design of the pages which I downloaded from a free templates (it is credited in footer of the pages).
Since this application was a mix of JS and PHP there is a lot of JSON use. The application doesn't use a database, instead for data storage were used cookies and web storage. The animations were created with Green Sock Animation Platform (GSAP) JS library.
